## Project Overview
In this project, we focused on the following key areas:

Task 1: Adding Contents
 - Introduced Vue.js basics by adding dynamic and static content to the application.
 - Learned how to mount Vue instances and manage the DOM.

Task 2: V-Bind
 - Implemented data binding using v-bind to dynamically update attributes such as src, alt, or href.

Task 3: Conditional Rendering
 - Used v-if, v-else-if, and v-show to render elements conditionally based on dynamic states.

Task 4: List Rendering
 - Explored rendering lists with the v-for directive.
 - Learned to iterate through arrays and display dynamic lists.

Task 5: Event Handling
 - Implemented user interaction features using v-on for event handling.

Task 6: Class & Style Binding
 - Dynamically applied CSS classes and inline styles using v-bind:class and v-bind:style.

Task 7: Computed Properties
- Leveraged computed properties to optimize logic and perform reactive calculations.
